# AllStrip
PHP ascii stripper for scene releases
Being too lazy to edit ascii art repeatedly this is an attempt at an intelligent ascii stripper. mostly aimed at scene groups.

It is also intended to handle non-scene .nfo's in a useful way.

Due to the fact that as soon as I get it all working some group will change their .nfo layout this will in all probability never be a finished product, requiring constant updates, so don't expect it to work 100%.

Since I don't have unlimited time to update it, there may be some delays in fixing new .nfo layout handling.
